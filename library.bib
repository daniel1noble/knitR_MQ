  abstract = {A key relationship in ecology is that between density and body size, with the emphasis placed on energetic rules constraining the abundance of larger organisms below that of smaller organisms. Most studies have focused upon the density-body size relationship at the species level. However, energy is gathered at an individual level. We therefore examined this relationship in a coral reef fish assemblage, focusing on individuals. Using a comprehensive data set, with over 14,000 observations we found that the relationship between local density and adult body size differs from the linear relationship predicted by the 'energetic equivalence rule'. However, excluding the smallest size classes, the relationship between body size and individual abundance for intermediate to larger fish did not depart from the predicted -0.75. Unlike plants and intermediate to large reef fishes, the smallest fishes appear to have constraints that may reflect different patterns of resource acquisition.},

Predictions are supported by global datasets from planktonic foraminifera for rates of DNA evolution and speciation spanning 30 million years. As predicted by the model, rates of speciation increase toward the tropics even after controlling for the greater ocean coverage at tropical latitudes. Our model and results indicate that individual metabolic rate is a primary determinant of evolutionary rates: ≈1013 J of energy flux per gram of tissue generates one substitution per nucleotide in the nuclear genome, and ≈1023 J of energy flux per population generates a new species of foraminifera.},

  abstract = {Ecologists have long recognized that species are sustained by the flux, storage and turnover of two biological currencies: energy, which fuels biological metabolism and materials (i.e. chemical elements), which are used to construct biomass. Ecological theories often describe the dynamics of populations, communities and ecosystems in terms of either energy (e.g. population-dynamics theory) or materials (e.g. resource-competition theory). These two classes of theory have been formulated using different assumptions, and yield distinct, but often complementary predictions for the same or similar phenomena. For example, the energy-based equation of von Bertalanffy and the nutrient-based equation of Droop both describe growth. Yet, there is relatively little theoretical understanding of how these two distinct classes of theory, and the currencies they use, are interrelated. Here, we begin to address this issue by integrating models and concepts from two rapidly developing theories, the metabolic theory of ecology and ecological stoichiometry theory. We show how combining these theories, using recently published theory and data along with new theoretical formulations, leads to novel predictions on the flux, storage and turnover of energy and materials that apply to animals, plants and unicells. The theory and results presented here highlight the potential for developing a more general ecological theory that explicitly relates the energetics and stoichiometry of individuals, communities and ecosystems to subcellular structures and processes. We conclude by discussing the basic and applied implications of such a theory, and the prospects and challenges for further development.},

  abstract = {Coral reefs are rich in biodiversity, in large part because their highly complex architecture provides shelter and resources for a wide range of organisms. Recent rapid declines in hard coral cover have occurred across the Caribbean region, but the concomitant consequences for reef architecture have not been quantified on a large scale to date. We provide, to our knowledge, the first region-wide analysis of changes in reef architectural complexity, using nearly 500 surveys across 200 reefs, between 1969 and 2008. The architectural complexity of Caribbean reefs has declined nonlinearly with the near disappearance of the most complex reefs over the last 40 years. The flattening of Caribbean reefs was apparent by the early 1980s, followed by a period of stasis between 1985 and 1998 and then a resumption of the decline in complexity to the present. Rates of loss are similar on shallow (<6 m), mid-water (6–20 m) and deep (>20 m) reefs and are consistent across all five subregions. The temporal pattern of declining architecture coincides with key events in recent Caribbean ecological history: the loss of structurally complex Acropora corals, the mass mortality of the grazing urchin Diadema antillarum and the 1998 El Nino Southern Oscillation-induced worldwide coral bleaching event. The consistently low estimates of current architectural complexity suggest regional-scale degradation and homogenization of reef structure. The widespread loss of architectural complexity is likely to have serious consequences for reef biodiversity, ecosystem functioning and associated environmental services.},

  abstract = {The objective of this paper is to find good proxies that are important to explain the spatial variation of beta/delta diversity in coral reefs. To reach that objective, we looked for and identified the environmental and spatial variables most strongly related to variation in fish and coral species richness and composition. We studied variation in fish and coral species diversity at two spatial scales: among geomorphology classes (reef lagoons, fronts, slopes and terraces) within reefs (beta diversity), and among eleven reefs across a 400-km latitudinal diversity gradient (delta diversity) in the western Caribbean Sea. The variation of species richness and community composition was partitioned between environmental and spatial variables. Two-way ANOVA (for richness) and MANOVA (for presence-absence community composition) were used to test for the influence of reefs and geomorphology classes on fish and coral species richness and community composition. The results show that for both fish and coral, differences among geomorphology classes were strong whereas there were no significant differences among the reefs. We identified additional spatially-structured environmental variables that explained the spatial variation of fish and coral species richness and community composition at the various scales. Geomorphological structure, “reefscape” attributes at different scales, and depth are important variables for shaping beta/delta diversity. We discuss the impact of our results with respect to regional ecomanagement strategies and the creation of marine reserves.},

The two fields were disturbed in late spring 1981 by clipping and removing aboveground plant biomass in experimental plots, which were compared with undisturbed control plots. Treatments represented three intensities of disturbance (low, intermediate, and high), as defined by amount of biomass removed and extent of canopy disruption. Different patterns of change in richness were observed in each field during the 1981 growing season. In the older field the number of species decreased in control plots during the summer. In disturbed plots, richness increased with intensity of disturbance, resulting in maximum richness at the highest disturbance intensity during mid- and late summer. Several species increased significantly in cover and/or frequency in plots representing intermediate and high intensity of disturbance. In the young field, species richness fluctuated in control plots, with peaks in early and late summer. In disturbed plots, richness decreased with intensity of disturbance in early summer and increased in midsummer. By late summer no difference in richness or species composition was detected between control and clipped plots. These patterns of change in richness can be explained by the different effect of treatments on the vegetation structure and by the role of the dominant species in each field. In the bi-layered older field, disturbances greatly disrupted the closed canopy of S. canadensis, thus providing resource patches (i.e., increased light, moisture) for suppressed and invading species. In the younger field, the impact of disturbance was only detectable in early and midsummer, and changes in richness were mainly related to the seasonal cycle of the dominant annual A. artemisiifolia. Results from these experiments provide insights into the mechanisms of species coexistence under natural disturbance regimes comparable to our disturbance treatments. They also indicate that the impact of disturbance on species richness depends largely on the nature of the dominants and rates of successional or seasonal change of the community.},

Here, we do so by synthesising a large compilation of fish metabolic-rate data with a comprehensive database on reef-fish community abundance and biomass. Individual-level analyses support predictions of Metabolic Theory after accounting for significant family-level variation, and indicate that some tropical reef fishes may already be experiencing thermal regimes at or near their temperature optima. Community-level analyses indicate that total estimated respiratory fluxes of reef-fish communities increase on average ~2-fold from 22 to 28 °C. Comparisons of estimated fluxes among trophic groups highlight striking differences in resource use by communities in different regions, perhaps partly reflecting distinct evolutionary histories, and support the hypothesis that piscivores receive substantial energy subsidies from outside reefs. Our study demonstrates one approach to synthesising individual- and community-level data to establish broad-scale trends in contributions of biota to ecosystem dynamics.},

  abstract = {Aim To determine whether the diversity of resident and transient coral-dwelling fish responds differentially to gradients in regional species richness. Location Three regions in the Indo-Pacific (Red Sea, western Indian Ocean, Great Barrier Reef) which contain increasingly larger regional diversities of reef fish. Methods I surveyed fish residing within branching coral species. Fish species were a priori categorized as resident or transient based on the degree of affiliation between the fish and live coral. To compare among regions that differ in coral diversity I used a modified species-volume relationship (SVR). Each point in the SVR represents the total number of fish species, resident or transient, found within the cumulative volume of a specific coral species. Empirical SVRs were further compared with random-placement null models. Results For transient species, I found that the observed SVRs did not differ consistently from those expected from random samples drawn from the corresponding regional species pools. In addition, for a given volume of coral, more fish species were found in richer regions, indicating strong regional influences on local diversity. In contrast, resident richness was lower than that expected from random samples of the species pool, and richness in rich regions was reduced comparably more than in poor regions. The SVRs of resident species were similar among regions with different regional diversities. Main conclusion These results suggest that, within coral species, transient fish richness is mostly influenced by stochastic allocation of species from the regional pool. Conversely, richness of resident species within a coral species is limited, making it independent of regional diversity. Since higher regional diversity of resident fish was not accompanied by higher richness per coral species or by decreased niche breadth, higher regional diversity of resident fish species must be rooted in higher coral richness. Consequently, ecological interactions between functional groups (coral and fish) can be powerful drivers of regional biodiversity.},

  abstract = {The size of the regional species pool may influence local patterns of diversity. However, it is unclear whether certain spatial scales are less sensitive to regional influences than others. Additive partitioning was used to separate coral-dwelling fish diversity to its alpha and beta components, at multiple scales, in several regions across the Indo-Pacific. We then examined how the relative contribution of these components changes with increased regional diversity. By employing specific random-placement null models, we overcome methodological problems with local-regional regressions. We show that, although alpha and beta diversities within each region are consistently different from random-placement null models, the increase in beta diversities among regions was similar to that predicted once heterogeneity in coral habitat was accounted for. In contrast, alpha diversity within single coral heads was limited and increased less than predicted by the null models. This was correlated with increased intraspecific aggregation in more diverse regions and is consistent with ecological limitations on the number of coexisting species at the local scale. These results suggest that, apart from very small spatial scales, variation in the partitioning of fish diversity along regional species richness gradients is driven overwhelmingly by the corresponding gradients in coral assemblage structure.},

We present and test a method whereby the upper bound slope can be measured by dividing assemblage data into size classes, and using the highest abundance in each class to estimate the regression slope. The method accurately estimates slopes from simulated data of known upper bound, and estimates from real and simulated data vary in a similar manner when different numbers of size classes are used. We conclude that this method may be used with confidence to estimate upper bound slopes from polygonal relationships, and gives the first chance to test different hypotheses about the magnitude of such slopes.},

We compared these attributes among flowering plants, grasshoppers, butterflies, lizards, summer birds, winter birds, and rodents across 48 plots in the grasslands and mesquite—oak savannas of southeastern Arizona. Species richness and evenness were uncorrelated or weakly negatively correlated for each taxonomic group, supporting the conclusion that richness alone is an incomplete measure of diversity. In each case, richness was positively correlated with one or more measures of abundance. By contrast, evenness usually was negatively correlated with the abundance variables, reflecting the fact that plots with high evenness generally were those where all species present were about equally uncommon. Therefore richness, but not evenness, usually was a positive predictor of places of conservation value, if these are defined as places where species of interest are especially abundant. Species diversity was more positively correlated with evenness than with richness among grasshoppers and flowering plants, in contrast to the other taxonomic groups, and the positive correlations between richness and abundance were comparatively weak for grasshoppers and plants as well. Both of these differences can be attributed to the fact that assemblages of plants and grasshoppers were numerically dominated by small subsets of common species (grasses and certain spur-throated grasshoppers) whose abundances differed greatly among plots in ways unrelated to species richness of the groups as a whole.},

  abstract = {Rates of change in final summer densities of two desert annuals, Eriogonum abertianum and Haplopappus gracilis, as constrained by their initial winter germination densities were estimated with regression quantiles and compared with mechanistic fits based on a self-thinning rule proposed by Guo et al. (1998); Oikos 83: 237-245). The allometric relation used was equivalent to S=N<sub>f</sub>(N<sub>i</sub>)<sup>-1</sup>=c<sub>f</sub>(N<sub>i</sub>)<sup>-1</sup>, where S is the ratio of final to initial densities (survivorship), c<sub>f</sub> is a constant that is a final density specific to the species and environment, N<sub>i</sub> is the initial plant density, and N<sub>f</sub> is final plant density. We used regression quantiles to estimate c<sub>f</sub> assuming the exponent of - 1 was fixed (model 1, N<sub>f</sub>(N<sub>i</sub>)<sup>-1</sup>=c<sub>f</sub>(N<sub>i</sub>)<sup>-1</sup>) and also obtained estimates by treating the exponent as a parameter to estimate (model 2, N<sub>f</sub>(N<sub>i</sub>)<sup>-1</sup>=c<sub>f</sub>(N<sub>i</sub>)<sup>λ</sup>). Regression quantiles allow rates of change to be estimated through any part of a data distribution conditional on some linear function of covariates. We focused on estimates for upper (90-99th) quantiles near the boundary of the summer density distributions where we expected effects of self-thinning to operate as the primary constraint on plant performance. Allometric functions estimated with regression quantiles were similar to functions fit by Guo et al. (1998) when the exponent was constrained to - 1. However, the data were more consistent with estimates for model (2), where exponents were closer to - 0.4 than - 1, although model fit was not as good at higher initial plant densities as when the exponent was fixed at - 1. An exponential form (model 3, N<sub>f</sub>(N<sub>i</sub>)<sup>-1</sup>=c<sub>f</sub>(N<sub>i</sub>)<sup>λ</sup> e<sup>γ N<sub>i</sub></sup>) that is a generalization of the discrete logistic growth function, where estimates of λ were - 0.23 to - 0.28 and estimates of γ were - 0.003 to - 0.006, provided better fit from low to high initial germination densities. Model 3 predictions were consistent with an interpretation that final summer densities were constrained by initial germination densities when these were low (<latex>$<40\ {\rm per}\ 0.25\ {\rm m}^{2}$</latex> for Eriogonum and <latex>$<100\ {\rm per}\ 0.25\ {\rm m}^{2}$</latex> for Haplopappus) and were constrained by the self-thinning process at higher germination densities. Our exponential model (3) estimated with regression quantiles had similar form to the mechanistic relation of Guo et al. (1998) when plotted as a survivorship function, but avoided the unrealistic assumption that all populations attained a similar final density, and was based on a statistical model that has formal rules for estimation and inference.},

  abstract = {Quantile regression is a way to estimate the conditional quantiles of a response variable distribution in the linear model that provides a more complete view of possible causal relationships between variables in ecological processes. Typically, all the factors that affect ecological processes are not measured and included in the statistical models used to investigate relationships between variables associated with those processes. As a consequence, there may be a weak or no predictive relationship between the mean of the response variable (y) distribution and the measured predictive factors (X). Yet there may be stronger, useful predictive relationships with other parts of the response variable distribution. This primer relates quantile regression estimates to prediction intervals in parametric error distribution regression models (eg least squares), and discusses the ordering characteristics, interval nature, sampling variation, weighting, and interpretation of the estimates for homogeneous and heterogeneous regression models.},

  abstract = {Processes occurring at the end of the larval stage are of major importance in shaping spatial structure of fish assemblages in coral reefs. However, because of the difficulty in identifying larvae to species, many studies dealing with these stages are limited to the family level. It remains unknown if variation in the spatial structure of coral-reef fish assemblages across life stages can be detected at such a coarse taxonomic level. Two different surveys conducted in a similar area of New Caledonia, Southwest Pacific, provided the opportunity to compare the structure of coral-reef fish assemblages collected as pre-settlement larvae, juveniles and adults along a coast to barrier reef gradient. Adult and juvenile fish were sampled using underwater visual counts (UVC) during the warm seasons of 2004 and 2005. Pre-settlement larvae were sampled with light-traps during the same seasons. In order to standardize data between sampling methods, analyses were conducted on the relative abundance (for larvae) and density (for juveniles and adults) of 21 families commonly collected with both methods. Relative abundances/densities of families were analysed as a function of life stage (larvae, juveniles or adults), large-scale spatial location (coast, lagoon or barrier) and years (2004, 2005) using non-parametric multidimensional scaling (nMDS) and permutational multivariate analysis of variance (permanova). Kruskal–Wallis tests were then used to examine differences among life stages and locations for individual families. Different levels of spatial and temporal variability characterized fish assemblages from different life stages, and differences among life stages were detected at all locations and years. Differences among life stages were also significant at the level of individual families. Overall results indicate that studies conducted at the family level may efficiently reveal changes in coral-reef fish spatial structure among successive life stages when large spatial scales are considered.},

  abstract = {A newly discovered sequence of lower to middle Miocene rocks from the eastern Bocas del Toro archipelago, western Panama, reveals the timing and environment of the earliest stages in the rise of the Isthmus of Panama in this region. Two new formations, the Punta Alegre Formation (lower Miocene, Aquitanian to Burdigalian) and the Valiente Formation (middle Miocene, Langhian to Serravallian), are here named and formally described. The Punta Alegre Formation contains a diagnostic microfauna of benthic and planktic foraminifera and calcareous nannofossils that indicate deposition in a 2000-m-deep pre-isthmian neotropical ocean from as old as 21.5–18.3 Ma. Its lithology varies from silty mudstone to muddy foraminiferal ooze with rare thin microturbidite layers near the top. The Valiente Formation, which ranges in age from 16.4 to ca. 12.0 Ma, lies with slight angular unconformity on the Punta Alegre Formation and consists of five lithofacies: (1) columnar basalt and flow breccia, (2) pyroclastic deposits, (3) coarse-grained volcaniclastic deposits, (4) coral-reef limestone with diverse large coral colonies, and (5) marine debris-flow deposits and microturbidites. These lithofacies are interpreted to indicate that after ca. 16 Ma a volcanic arc developed in the region of Bocas del Toro and that by ca. 12 Ma an extensively emergent archipelago of volcanic islands had formed. 39Ar/40Ar dating of basalt flows associated with the fossiliferous sedimentary rocks in the upper part of the Valiente Formation strongly confirms the ages derived from planktic foraminifera and nannofossils. Paleobathymetric analysis of the two new formations in the Valiente Peninsula and Popa Island, in the Bocas del Toro archipelago, shows a general shallowing from lower- through upper-bathyal to upper-neritic and emergent laharic and fluviatile deposits from ca. 19 to 12 Ma. The overlying nonconformable Bocas del Toro Group contains a lower transgressive sequence ranging from basal nearshore sandstone to upper-bathyal mudstone (ca. 8.1–5.3 Ma) and an upper regressive sequence (5.3–3.5 Ma). A similar paleobathymetric pattern is observed from the Gatun to Chagres Formations (12–6 Ma) in the Panama Canal Basin area and in the Uscari, Rio Banana, Quebrada Chocolate, and Moin Formations (8–1.7 Ma) in the southern Limón Basin of Costa Rica.},

This study tested whether the LSR-RSR relationship for coral species was linear or curvilinear at three local scales across the west-central Pacific Ocean, along a regional biodiversity gradient that includes the world's most diverse coral assemblages. The local scales comprised transects 10(0-2) m apart, sites 10(3-4) m apart and islands 10(4-6) m apart. The LSR-RSR relationship was never significantly different from linear at any scale. When the Chao1 estimator was used to predict true RSR and LSR, all relationships were also strongly linear. We conclude that local assemblages are open to regional influences even when the local scale is very small relative to the regional scale, and even in extraordinarily rich regions.},

  abstract = {Community ecologists have struggled to create unified theories across diverse ecosystems, but it has been difficult to acertain whether marine and terrestrial communities differ in the mechanisms responsible for structure and dynamics. One apparent difference between marine and terrestrial ecology is that the influence of regional processes on local populations and communities is better established in the marine literature. We examine three potential explanations: 1) influential early studies emphasized local interactions in terrestrial communities and regional dispersal in marine communities. 2) regional-scale processes are actually more important in marine than in terrestrial communities. 3) recruitment from a regional species pool is easier to study in marine than terrestrial communities. We conclude that these are interrelated, but that the second and especially the third explanations are more important than the first. We also conclude that in both marine and terrestrial systems, there are ways to improve our understanding of regional influences on local community diversity. In particular, we advocate examining local vs regional diversity relationships at localities within environmentally similar regions that differ in their diversity either because of their sizes or their varying degrees of isolation from a species source.},

Rates of diversification analysis revealed elevated cladogenesis in all families in the Oligocene/Miocene. Throughout the Miocene, lineages with a high percentage of coral reef-associated taxa display significantly higher net diversification rates than expected. The development of a complex mosaic of reef habitats in the Indo-Australian Archipelago (IAA) during the Oligocene/Miocene appears to have been a significant driver of cladogenesis. Patterns of diversification suggest that coral reefs acted as a refuge from high extinction, as reef taxa are able to sustain diversification at high extinction rates. The IAA appears to support both cladogenesis and survival in associated lineages, laying the foundation for the recent IAA marine biodiversity hotspot.},

Density (D) is known to vary strongly with body weight (W), while allometric scaling of population energy use is disputed. The present study examines this variability in reported species densities and energy consumption to test the hypothesis that the patterns are related to environmental energy levels and to the efficiency of energy utilization. We found that the intercepts, but not slopes, of density-body size relationships of the form log D = a + b log W differ significantly among broad groups: invertebrates, vertebrate ectotherms, mammals and birds. An overall regression that distinguishes among these groups using dummy variables has a much shallower slope (-0.56) than most other literature estimates. Moreover, most of the interspecific variability in density is related to differences in the mean densities of these groups (the dummy variables), not to body size per se. Mean population density is also strongly, but negatively, related to potential evapotranspiration, a measure of crude atmospheric energy. Population energy use decreases with body size in the pooled data, but it increases within these metabolic groups because of the shallower relationship between density and body mass. Population energy use also increases slightly with latitude, both because mean body size increases poleward, and independently of body size.},

  abstract = {Broad-scale variation in taxonomic richness is strongly correlated with climate. Many mechanisms have been hypothesized to explain these patterns; however, testable predictions that would distinguish among them have rarely been derived. Here, we examine several prominent hypotheses for climate–richness relationships, deriving and testing predictions based on their hypothesized mechanisms. The ‘energy–richness hypothesis’ (also called the ‘more individuals hypothesis’) postulates that more productive areas have more individuals and therefore more species. More productive areas do often have more species, but extant data are not consistent with the expected causal relationship from energy to numbers of individuals to numbers of species. We reject the energy–richness hypothesis in its standard form and consider some proposed modifications. The ‘physiological tolerance hypothesis’ postulates that richness varies according to the tolerances of individual species for different sets of climatic conditions. This hypothesis predicts that more combinations of physiological parameters can survive under warm and wet than cold or dry conditions. Data are qualitatively consistent with this prediction, but are inconsistent with the prediction that species should fill climatically suitable areas. Finally, the ‘speciation rate hypothesis’ postulates that speciation rates should vary with climate, due either to faster evolutionary rates or stronger biotic interactions increasing the opportunity for evolutionary diversification in some regions. The biotic interactions mechanism also has the potential to amplify shallower, underlying gradients in richness. Tests of speciation rate hypotheses are few (to date), and their results are mixed.},

This independence is represented by the slope of the regressions approximating –0.75, the reciprocal of the way that individual metabolic requirements scale with body mass. The pattern still holds for mammalian primary consumers when the data are broken down by geographic area, by broad habitat-type and by individual community. Slopes for mammalian secondary consumers are also not statistically distinguishable from –0.75. For any given body mass temperate herbivores maintain on average population densities of 1.5 to 2.0 times those of tropical ones, though slopes do not differ. Terrestrial animals of all sizes exhibit approximately the same range of population energy-use values. These results agree with those reported for population energy-budgets. It is suggested that rough independence of body mass and the energy-use of local populations is a widespread rule of animal ecology and community structure.},

Metabolic rate scales with body mass superlinearly in prokaryotes, linearly in protists, and sublinearly in metazoans, so Kleiber’s 3/4 power scaling law does not apply universally across organisms. The scaling of maximum population growth rate shifts from positive in prokaryotes to negative in protists and metazoans, and the efficiency of production declines across these groups. Major changes in metabolic processes during the early evolution of life overcame existing constraints, exploited new opportunities, and imposed new constraints.},

This results in a list of 23 function types, which are applicable both for untransformed (S) and for log-transformed (log S) species richness. Then, example data sets for nested plots in continuous vegetation (n = 14) and islands (n = 6) are fitted to a selection of 12 function types (linear, power, logarithmic, saturation, sigmoid) both for S and for log S. The suitability of these models is assessed with Akaike’s information criterion for S and log S, and with a newly proposed metric that addresses extrapolation capability.Results  SARs, which provide species numbers for different areas and have no upper asymptote, must be distinguished from SSRs, which approach the species richness of one single area asymptotically. Among SARs, nested plots in continuous ecosystems, non-nested plots in continuous ecosystems, and isolates can be distinguished. For the SARs of the empirical data sets, the normal and quadratic power functions as well as two of the sigmoid functions (Lomolino, cumulative beta-P) generally performed well. The normal power function (fitted for S) was particularly suitable for predicting richness values over ten-fold increases in area. Linear, logarithmic, convex saturation and logistic functions generally were inappropriate. However, the two sigmoid models produced unstable results with arbitrary parameter estimates, and the quadratic power function resulted in decreasing richness values for large areas.Main conclusions  Based on theoretical considerations and empirical results, I suggest that the power law should be used to describe and compare any type of SAR while at the same time testing whether the exponent z changes with spatial scale. In addition, one should be aware that power-law parameters are significantly influenced by methodology.},

These MLCDs vary in size, habitat quality, and management regimes, providing an excellent opportunity to test hypotheses concerning marine protected area (MPA) design and function using multiple discreet sampling units. Digital benthic habitat maps for all MLCDs and adjacent habitats were used to evaluate the efficacy of existing MLCDs and adjacent habitats using a spatially explicit stratified random sampling design. Most fish assemblage characteristics (e.g. species richness, biomass, number of individuals) were highest in colonized hard bottom habitats (&gt;10% live coral cover), followed by uncolonized hard bottom habitats (&lt;10% live coral cover), macroalgae, and sand, respectively. Although biomass was low in sand habitats, apex predators accounted for 62% of the biomass on sand within MLCDs, highlighting the importance of this habitat in reserve design. Within habitats, values for assemblage characteristics were typically higher for MLCDs compared with adjacent areas, emphasizing the importance of protection from fishing irrespective of habitat. Rugosity explained much of the variability in species richness and biomass across all locations. Overall, MLCDs protected from fishing, with high habitat complexity and good habitat quality (e.g. high coral cover and low macroalgae cover), had higher values for most fish assemblage characteristics. Integrating mapping and assessment of reef fish habitat utilization patterns allowed for a robust approach to MPA evaluation and can help inform decisions about MPA design and effectiveness, as well as helping to define essential fish habitat and ecosystem function.},

  abstract = {In order to properly determine the efficacy of marine protected areas (MPAs), a seascape perspective that integrates ecosystem elements at the appropriate ecological scale is necessary. Over the past four decades, Hawaii has developed a system of 11 Marine Life Conservation Districts (MLCDs) to conserve and replenish marine resources around the state. Initially established to provide opportunities for public interaction with the marine environment, these MLCDs vary in size, habitat quality, and management regimes, providing an excellent opportunity to test hypotheses concerning MPA design and function using multiple discrete sampling units. Digital benthic habitat maps for all MLCDs and adjacent habitats were used to evaluate the efficacy of existing MLCDs using a spatially explicit stratified random sampling design. Analysis of benthic cover validated the a priori classification of habitat types and provided justification for using these habitat strata to conduct stratified random sampling and analyses of fish habitat utilization patterns. Results showed that a number of fish assemblage characteristics (e.g., species richness, biomass, diversity) vary among habitat types, but were significantly higher in MLCDs compared with adjacent fished areas across all habitat types. Overall fish biomass was 2.6 times greater in the MLCDs compared to open areas. In addition, apex predators and other species were more abundant and larger in the MLCDs, illustrating the effectiveness of these closures in conserving fish populations within their boundaries. Habitat type, protected area size, and level of protection from fishing were all important determinates of MLCD effectiveness with respect to their associated fish assemblages. Although size of these protected areas was positively correlated with a number of fish assemblage characteristics, all appear too small to have any measurable influence on the adjacent fished areas. These protected areas were not designed for biodiversity conservation or fisheries enhancement yet still provide varying degrees of protection for fish populations within their boundaries. Implementing this type of biogeographic process, using remote sensing technology and sampling across the range of habitats present within the seascape, provides a robust evaluation of existing MPAs and can help to define ecologically relevant boundaries for future MPA design in a range of locations.},

	* An expedition to Salas y Gómez and Easter islands was conducted to develop a comprehensive baseline of the nearshore marine ecosystem, to survey seamounts of the recently created Motu Motiro Hiva Marine Park (MMHMP) – a no-take marine reserve of 150 000 km2 – and to compare these results with Easter Island where the marine ecosystem is similar but has no marine protection.
	* Live coral cover was surprisingly high at both Easter Island (53%) and Salas y Gómez (44%), especially considering their sub-tropical location, high wave energy environments, and geographic isolation.
	* Endemic and regionally-endemic species comprised 77% of the fish abundance at Easter Island and 73% at Salas y Gómez. Fish biomass at Salas y Gómez was relatively high (1.2 t ha-1) and included a large proportion of apex predators (43%), whereas at Easter Island it was almost three times lower (0.45 t ha-1) with large predators accounting for less than 2% of the biomass, despite good habitat quality.
	* The large cohort of small sharks and the absence of larger sharks at Salas y Gómez suggest mesopredator release consistent with recent shark fishing. The fish fauna at the seamounts between Easter Island and Salas y Gómez, outside of MMHMP, harboured 46% endemic species, including a new species of damselfish (Chromis sp. nov.) and probably a new species of Chimaera (Hydrolagus). Numerous seamounts adjacent to Salas y Gómez are currently not included in the MMHMP.
	* This expedition highlights the high biodiversity value of this remote part of the Pacific owing to the uniqueness (endemicity) of the fauna, large apex predator biomass, and geographic isolation.Copyright © 2013 John Wiley & Sons, Ltd.},

Here I review the current understanding of the nature of commonness, with particular emphasis on the dynamics and causes of this state, as well as on its ecological and evolutionary implications. Depending on the focal issue, common species can variously have lower, greater, or similar per capita influences compared with rare ones. Importantly, however, these influences almost invariably remain strong because of the high numbers of individuals and local occurrences in taxonomic assemblages contributed by the relatively few species that are common. The importance of these species highlights the significance of deepening concerns over the declines of many common species and the vital need for a balanced approach to maintaining their commonness while also addressing the more familiar conservation issue of preventing the loss of rare species.},

  abstract = {In longitudinal studies, measurements of the same individuals are taken repeatedly through time. Often, the primary goal is to characterize the change in response over time and the factors that influence change. Factors can affect not only the location but also more generally the shape of the distribution of the response over time. To make inference about the shape of a population distribution, the widely popular mixed-effects regression, for example, would be inadequate, if the distribution is not approximately Gaussian. We propose a novel linear model for quantile regression (QR) that includes random effects in order to account for the dependence between serial observations on the same subject. The notion of QR is synonymous with robust analysis of the conditional distribution of the response variable. We present a likelihood-based approach to the estimation of the regression quantiles that uses the asymmetric Laplace density. In a simulation study, the proposed method had an advantage in terms of mean squared error of the QR estimator, when compared with the approach that considers penalized fixed effects. Following our strategy, a nearly optimal degree of shrinkage of the individual effects is automatically selected by the data and their likelihood. Also, our model appears to be a robust alternative to the mean regression with random effects when the location parameter of the conditional distribution of the response is of interest. We apply our model to a real data set which consists of self-reported amount of labor pain measurements taken on women repeatedly over time, whose distribution is characterized by skewness, and the significance of the parameters is evaluated by the likelihood ratio statistic.},

Habitat diversity was measured along 3 dimensions judged important to a wide range of fish groups and applicable to many stream conditions: stream depth, bottom type, and current. Increasing community and habitat diversity followed stream-order gradients. Natural streams supported fish communities of high species diversity which were seasonally more stable than the lower-diversity communities of modified streams. After disturbances such as channelization, seasonal peaks in species diversity attain levels typical of undisturbed streams. Because seasonal changes in stream quality are high, the stability of the fish community is lower in modified than in natural streams. The general correlation between habitat characteristics and presence and absence of fish species suggests that most fishes of small streams are habitat specialists.},

  abstract = {Species richness is a fundamental measurement of community and regional diversity, and it underlies many ecological models and conservation strategies. In spite of its importance, ecologists have not always appreciated the effects of abundance and sampling effort on richness measures and comparisons. We survey a series of common pitfalls in quantifying and comparing taxon richness. These pitfalls can be largely avoided by using accumulation and rarefaction curves, which may be based on either individuals or samples. These taxon sampling curves contain the basic information for valid richness comparisons, including category-subcategory ratios (species-to-genus and species-to-individual ratios). Rarefaction methods - both sample-based and individual-based - allow for meaningful standardization and comparison of datasets. Standardizing data sets by area or sampling effort may produce very different results compared to standardizing by number of individuals collected, and it is not always clear which measure of diversity is more appropriate. Asymptotic richness estimators provide lower-bound estimates for taxon-rich groups such as tropical arthropods, in which observed richness rarely reaches an asymptote, despite intensive sampling. Recent examples of diversity studies of tropical trees, stream invertebrates, and herbaceous plants emphasize the importance of carefully quantifying species richness using taxon sampling curves.},

We then applied the model to field data for two desert annual species measured over 384 permanent quadrats. Based on the self-thinning law, competition for limiting resources from conspecifics and heterospecifics places an upper boundary on the survivorship of desert annuals. Simple trade-off models are also developed to define constraint lines for another measure of performance, density under interspecific competition. Similar constraint lines can be potentially fitted to field data where still other factors also influence plant performance. Compared with most conventional methods, such as linear regression and multivariate techniques, models of constraint lines are better able to characterize the effects of the major limiting processes in complex systems in which many other factors contribute to the observed variation. This approach offers a powerful tool in dealing with complex ecological patterns; it should be generally applicable to many other systems.},

In these N-limited habitats, species abundance ranks correlated with their predicted competitive ranks: low R* species, on average dominated.

This hypothesis suggests that the number of species increases along the global energy gradient primarily as a result of an increase in the total number of individuals that can be supported along that gradient. Implicit in this hypothesis is that species richness should scale with energy in the same way in which it scales with area in species‐area relationships. We developed a novel framework for thinking about the interaction of area and energy, and we provide the first global test of this equivalence assumption using a data set on terrestrial breeding birds. We found that (1) species‐energy slopes are typically greater than species‐area slopes, (2) the magnitude of species‐area and species‐energy slopes varies strongly across the globe, and (3) the degree to which area and energy interact to determine species richness depends on the way mean values of species occupancy change along the energy gradient. Our results indicate that the increase in richness along global productivity gradients cannot be explained by more individuals alone, and we discuss other mechanisms by which increased productivity might facilitate species coexistence.},

	Energy equivalence, the notion that population energy flux is independent of body mass, has become a key concept in ecology. We argue that energy equivalence is not an ecological ‘rule’, as claimed, but a flawed concept beset by circular reasoning. In fact, the independence of mass and energy flux is a null hypothesis. We show that our mechanistic understanding of size–density relationships (SDRs) follows directly from this null model and the assumption that energy limits abundance. Paradoxically, without this assumption energy equivalence has no meaning and we lack a mechanistic understanding for SDRs. We derive an expression for the strength (r
	2) of SDRs under the null model, which provides a framework within which to compare published SDRs. This confirms that tight correlations between mass and abundance are a trivial consequence of the span of body masses considered. Our model implies that energy flux varies by five to six orders of magnitude among similarly sized mammals and to a far greater extent in birds. We conclude that the energetic paradigm can be strengthened by considering alternative, non-energetic, hypotheses.

  abstract = {1. In many groups of species, range size and population density are positively correlated (the ‘distribution−abundance relationship’) and range size is positively correlated with latitude (‘Rapoport's Rule’). This study investigated these two relationships among Australian forest mammals, and also tested for the existence of a relationship between population density and latitude in the same fauna.2. All three relationships were significant, with the distribution–abundance relationship the strongest pattern of the three, and Rapoport's Rule the weakest. Partial correlation analysis showed that: (i) range size and population density remained positively correlated when latitude was held constant; and (ii) population density and latitude remained positively correlated when range size was held constant; but (iii) latitude and range size were not significantly correlated when population density was held constant. For (i) and (ii), partial correlation did not reveal stronger relationships than were revealed by simple correlation. These results suggest that the distribution–abundance relationship is conditioned by latitude to produce small ranges and low population densities in the tropics, and that tropical species tend to have low population densities relative to range size.3. Body mass accounted for little variation in population density, and for no variation in range size and latitudinal position. The small ranges and low population densities of tropical species were not related to a latitudinal gradient in species richness, which did not occur in this fauna.4. The latitudinal gradient in population density held within widespread species as well as among species. The effect of Bergmann's Rule (the tendency for organisms in cool environments to be larger bodied than organisms in warm environments) meant that in some species, population energy use rose more steeply with latitude than did population density.5. I argue that all three relationships might be due to a tendency for the foraging efficiency of animals to be lower in tropical than in temperate ecosystems, as a result of a lower concentration of nutrients in tropical ecosystems. For resource-limited species, foraging efficiency should influence both range size and population density. Differences in foraging efficiency may therefore produce the distribution−abundance relationship as well as latitudinal gradients in range size and population density.},

  abstract = {Ecological communities are influenced by processes operating at multiple scales(1-5). Thus, a better understanding of how broad- as well as local-scale processes affect species diversity and richness is increasingly becoming a central focus in modern community ecology(6-9). Here, in a study of unprecedented geographical scope, we show significant regional and local variation in the species richness of coral assemblages across an oceanic biodiversity gradient. The gradient that we sampled extends 10,000 km eastwards from the world's richest coral biodiversity hotspot in the central Indo-Pacific(10). Local richness and the size of regional species pools decline significantly across 15 islands spanning the gradient. In addition, richness declines across three adjacent habitats ( reef slopes, crests and flats). In each habitat, a highly consistent linear relationship between local and regional species richness indicates strong regional enrichment. Thus, even on the most diverse coral reefs in the world, local coral assemblages are profoundly affected by regional-scale processes. Understanding these historical and biogeographical influences is essential for the effective management and preservation of these endangered communities.},

  abstract = {1200 measurements of eelgrass (Zostera marina) biomass, shoot density and cover along 19 depth gradients in Øresund, located between Denmark and Sweden, were analysed to characterise growth of eelgrass in relation to depth. The large data set allowed analyses of boundaries of distribution as well as of average trends. Natural variability is large in shallow water where populations are disturbed by wave action and other physical parameters. Models based on average values, therefore, did not adequately describe growth regulation by resources, and only explained a minor part (up to 30%) of the overall variation in data. In contrast, boundary functions, which describe the upper bounds of distributions, focus on the variation produced by the ultimately growth-regulating resource, and therefore provide models with high predictive power. An exponential model explained up to 90% of the variation in upper bounds of eelgrass shoot density as a function of depth and indicated that shoot density was ultimately regulated by light availability. The boundary functions demonstrated that eelgrass shoot density, biomass and cover followed markedly different patterns as functions of depth and were affected differently by the factors governing their distribution. In addition, boundary functions revealed informative spatial structures in data and illustrated whether a given general trend was caused by changes in maximum values, minimum values or both. For example, upper and lower boundaries of biomass-shoot density relations changed markedly with depth, demonstrating depth-related changes in intraspecific succession and competition patterns. Boundary functions are therefore suggested as a promising tool for analysing ultimate regulating factors of distribution and growth of organisms when large data sets are available.},

Here, we analyse how traits related to the pelagic dispersal and adult biology of 985 tropical reef fish species correlate with their establishing populations on both sides of two Atlantic marine barriers: the Mid-Atlantic Barrier (MAB) and the Amazon–Orinoco Plume (AOP). Generalized linear mixed-effects models indicate that predictors for successful barrier crossing are the ability to raft with flotsam for the deep-water MAB, non-reef habitat usage for the freshwater and sediment-rich AOP, and large adult-size and large latitudinal-range for both barriers. Variation in larval-development mode, often thought to be broadly related to larval-dispersal potential, is not a significant predictor in either case. Many more species of greater taxonomic diversity cross the AOP than the MAB. Rafters readily cross both barriers but represent a much smaller proportion of AOP crossers than MAB crossers. Successful establishment after crossing both barriers may be facilitated by broad environmental tolerance associated with large body size and wide latitudinal-range. These results highlight the need to look beyond larval-dispersal potential and assess adult-biology traits when assessing determinants of successful movements across marine barriers.},

However, empirical tests of this relationship have yielded mixed results, and alternative hypotheses have rarely been considered. Here we assess the relative influence of adult and larval-traits on geographic range size using a global dataset encompassing 590 species of tropical reef fishes in 47 families, the largest compilation of such data to date for any marine group. We analyze this database using linear mixed-effect models to control for phylogeny and geographical limits on range size. Our analysis indicates that three adult traits likely to affect the capacity of new colonizers to survive and establish reproductive populations (body size, schooling behavior, and nocturnal activity) are equal or better predictors of geographic range size than pelagic larval duration. We conclude that adult life-history traits that affect the postdispersal persistence of new populations are primary determinants of successful range extension and, consequently, of geographic range size among tropical reef fishes.},

Despite the increasing frequency of hierarchically structured sampling programs used in coral-reef science, little progress has been made in quantifying the relative importance of processes operating across multiple scales. The vast majority of reef studies are conducted, or at least analyzed, at a single spatial scale, ignoring the implicitly hierarchical structure of the overall system in favor of small-scale experiments or large-scale observations. Here we demonstrate how α (mean local number of species), β diversity (degree of species dissimilarity among local sites), and γ diversity (overall species richness) vary with spatial scale, and using a hierarchical, information-theoretic approach, we evaluate the relative importance of site-, reef-, and atoll-level processes driving the fish metacommunity structure among 10 atolls in French Polynesia. Process-based models, representing well-established hypotheses about drivers of reef-fish community structure, were assembled into a candidate set of 12 hierarchical linear models. Variation in fish abundance, biomass, and species richness were unevenly distributed among transect, reef, and atoll levels, establishing the relative contribution of variation at these spatial scales to the structure of the metacommunity. Reef-fish biomass, species richness, and the abundance of most functional-groups corresponded primarily with transect-level habitat diversity and atoll-lagoon size, whereas detritivore and grazer abundances were largely correlated with potential covariates of larval dispersal. Our findings show that (1) within-transect and among-atoll factors primarily drive the relationship between α and γ diversity in this reef-fish metacommunity; (2) habitat is the primary correlate with reef-fish metacommunity structure at multiple spatial scales; and (3) inter-atoll connectedness was poorly correlated with the nonrandom clustering of reef-fish species. These results demonstrate the importance of modeling hierarchical data and processes in understanding reef-fish metacommunity structure.},

Recent long-term sampling studies have concluded that mid-elevational peaks in species richness identified previously may have come from the short-term sampling regimes employed, and from disturbance at lower elevations. Long-term sampling seems likely to reveal peaks at lower elevations. Analysis of 20 studies taken from the literature add the possibility that the latitude at which a study is undertaken influences the elevation of peak species richness. A study of 12 open sites in the southeastern U.S., ranging in elevation from 100 m to 1700 m, reveals that both principal reasons advanced previously for mid-elevational peaks may be valid, if short-term sampling is employed. Taken together, all of the evidence indicates that a complex interplay of local ecological interactions, latitude, disturbance, and sampling regime determines the elevation of maximum insect species richness. The temporal and spatial scale employed strongly influences the evaluation of this ecological {"}pattern{"}.},

While a suite of disturbances (overfishing, eutrophication, and global climate change) have been identified, the mechanism(s) of reef system decline remain elusive. Increased microbial and viral loading with higher percentages of opportunistic and specific microbial pathogens have been identified as potentially unifying features of coral reefs in decline. Due to their relative size and high per cell activity, a small change in microbial biomass may signal a large reallocation of available energy in an ecosystem; that is the <italic>microbialization</italic> of the coral reef. Our hypothesis was that human activities alter the energy budget of the reef system, specifically by altering the allocation of metabolic energy between microbes and macrobes. To determine if this is occurring on a regional scale, we calculated the basal metabolic rates for the fish and microbial communities at 99 sites on twenty-nine coral islands throughout the Pacific Ocean using previously established scaling relationships. From these metabolic rate predictions, we derived a new metric for assessing and comparing reef health called the microbialization score. The microbialization score represents the percentage of the combined fish and microbial predicted metabolic rate that is microbial. Our results demonstrate a strong positive correlation between reef microbialization scores and human impact. In contrast, microbialization scores did not significantly correlate with ocean net primary production, local chl<italic>a</italic> concentrations, or the combined metabolic rate of the fish and microbial communities. These findings support the hypothesis that human activities are shifting energy to the microbes, at the expense of the macrobes. Regardless of oceanographic context, the microbialization score is a powerful metric for assessing the level of human impact a reef system is experiencing.</p>},

Unfortunately, very few models are ever rejected, primarily because few theories make any predictions beyond the hollow-curve SAD itself. (ii) Interesting work has been performed both empirically and theoretically, which goes beyond the hollow-curve prediction to provide a rich variety of information about how SADs behave. These include the study of SADs along environmental gradients and theories that integrate SADs with other biodiversity patterns. Central to this body of work is an effort to move beyond treating the SAD in isolation and to integrate the SAD into its ecological context to enable making many predictions.

Here we review two major hypotheses for the origin of the latitudinal diversity gradient. The time and area hypothesis holds that tropical climates are older and historically larger, allowing more opportunity for diversification. This hypothesis is supported by observations that temperate taxa are often younger than, and nested within, tropical taxa, and that diversity is positively correlated with the age and area of geographical regions. The diversification rate hypothesis holds that tropical regions diversify faster due to higher rates of speciation (caused by increased opportunities for the evolution of reproductive isolation, or faster molecular evolution, or the increased importance of biotic interactions), or due to lower extinction rates. There is phylogenetic evidence for higher rates of diversification in tropical clades, and palaeontological data demonstrate higher rates of origination for tropical taxa, but mixed evidence for latitudinal differences in extinction rates. Studies of latitudinal variation in incipient speciation also suggest faster speciation in the tropics. Distinguishing the roles of history, speciation and extinction in the origin of the latitudinal gradient represents a major challenge to future research.},

These two species exhibited similar patterns of habitat use and nearly identical ability to compete for vacant corals. Furthermore, there was a priority effect where the first species to occupy a vacant coral excluded an interspecific intruder of similar body size. The relative abundance of recruit and juvenile G. histrio and G. erythrospilus in the field matched the relative abundance of adults, as expected where there is no post-recruitment displacement by a competitive hierarchy. Finally, a reciprocal competitor-reduction experiment confirmed that G. histrio and G. erythrospilus compete for vacant space, with the removal of either species leading to an increase in the abundance of the other species. Therefore these two species are nearly ecologically equivalent and appear to coexist by means of a competitive lottery for vacant space.},

To address this, we quantified individual and lagoon-wide net (P<sub>n</sub>) and gross (P<sub>g</sub>) primary production by all dominant functional groups of benthic primary producers in a typical macrophyte-dominated Caribbean reef lagoon near Puerto Morelos (Mexico) via measurement of O<sub>2</sub> fluxes in incubation experiments. The photosynthetically active 3D lagoon surface area was quantified using conversion factors to allow extrapolation to lagoon-wide P budgets. Findings revealed that lagoon 2D benthic cover was primarily composed of sand-associated microphytobenthos (40%), seagrasses (29%) and macroalgae (27%), while seagrasses dominated the lagoon 3D surface area (84%). Individual P<sub>g</sub> was highest for macroalgae and scleractinian corals (87 and 86 mmol O<sub>2</sub> m<sup>−2</sup> specimen area d<sup>−1</sup>, respectively), however seagrasses contributed highest (59%) to the lagoon-wide P<sub>g</sub>. Macroalgae exhibited highest individual P<sub>n</sub> rates, but seagrasses generated the largest fraction (51%) of lagoon-wide P<sub>n</sub>. Individual R was highest for scleractinian corals and macroalgae, whereas seagrasses again provided the major lagoon-wide share (68%). These findings characterise the investigated lagoon as a net autotrophic coral reef ecosystem compartment revealing similar P compared to other macrophyte-dominated coastal environments such as seagrass meadows and macroalgae beds. Further, high lagoon-wide P (P<sub>g</sub>: 488 and P<sub>n</sub>: 181 mmol O<sub>2</sub> m<sup>−2</sup> lagoon area d<sup>−1</sup>) and overall P<sub>g</sub>:R (1.6) indicate substantial benthic excess production within the Puerto Morelos reef lagoon and suggest the export of newly synthesised organic matter to surrounding ecosystems.</p>},

Communities from Asia, Africa, Europe, and North, Central and South America were studied (60°4′N–41°4′S latitude) using the Gentry data base. Log–log linear stem size (diameter) frequency distributions were constructed for each community and the species richness and species-specific plant density within each size class were determined for each frequency distribution. Species richness in the smallest stem size class correlated with the Y-intercepts (β-values) of the regression curves describing each log–log linear size distributions. Two extreme community types were identified (designated as type A and type B). Type A communities had steep size distributions (i.e. large β-values), log–log linear species-richness size distributions, low species-specific plant density distributions, and a small size class (2–4 cm) containing the majority of all species but rarely conspecifics of the dominant tree species. Type B communities had shallow size distributions (i.e. small β-values), more or less uniform (and low) size class species- richness and species-specific density distributions and size-dominant species resident in the smallest size class. Type A communities were absent in the higher latitudes but increased in number towards the equator, i.e. in the smallest size class, species richness increased (and species-specific density decreased) towards the tropics. Based on our survey of type A and type B communities (and their intermediates), species richness evinces size-dependent and latitudinal trends, i.e. species richness increased with decreasing body size and most species increasingly reside in the smallest plant size class towards the tropics. Across all latitudes, a trade-off exists between the number of species and the number of individuals per species residing in the smaller size classes.},

The presence of Anolis wattsi both lowers the growth rates and raises the perch heights of Anolis gingivinus individuals. In contrast, Anolis wattsi has no effect on Anolis bimaculatus. Thus, when there is less resource partitioning, Anolis wattsi has a greater competitive effect. This verifies, for these species, a central assumption of competition theory: the strength of between-species competition is inversely related to the amount of interspecific resource partitioning.},

On a local scale, no relationship between latitude (10⚬ to 49⚬ N.) and diversity was found. On a geographic scale, an increased stability of annual production may lead to an increased capacity for systems to support higher-level carnivores. Hence tropical, or other, ecosystems are more diverse, and are characterized by disproportionately more carnivores.},

Using a spatial database for 6336 tropical reef fishes, we attempted to predict species richness according to geometric, biogeographical and environmental explanatory variables. In particular, we aimed to evaluate and disentangle the predictive performances of temperature, habitat area, connectivity, mid-domain effect and biogeographical region on reef fish species richness. We used boosted regression trees, a flexible machine-learning technique, to build our predictive model and structural equation modeling to test for potential ‘mediation effects’ among predictors. Our model proved to be accurate, explaining 80% of the total deviance in fish richness using a cross-validated procedure. Coral reef area and biogeographical region were the primary predictors of reef fish species richness, followed by coast length, connectivity, mid-domain effect and sea surface temperature, with interactions between the region and other predictors. Important indirect effects of water temperature on reef fish richness, mediated by coral reef area, were also identified. The relationship between environmental predictors and species richness varied markedly among biogeographical regions. Our analysis revealed that a few easily accessible variables can accurately predict reef fish species richness. They also highlight concerns regarding ongoing environmental declines, with region-specific responses to variation in environmental conditions predicting a variable response to anthropogenic impacts.},

	The response of fish assemblages to changes in protection status is a major issue for both biodiversity conservation and fishery management. In New Caledonia, the Aboré reef marine reserve harbours more than 500 fish species, and has been subjected to changes in protection status since 1988. The present study investigates the impact of these changes on a wide subset of species (213), based on underwater visual counts collected before the opening and after the closure to fishing of this marine protected area (MPA). We analysed the spatial and temporal variability in fish assemblage attributable to protection status, explicitly considering habitat. To understand the successive responses of fish assemblage to fishing and protection, the assessment models included four criteria defining species groups that partition the fish assemblage: trophic regime, adult size, mobility, and interest for fishing. We could therefore identify the negative impact of opening the MPA to fishing on piscivores and highly mobile species. Surprisingly, target species were not affected more than non-target species. Model results were used to identify species groups that respond to fishing and protection. These results utilize fisheries-related criteria to provide new insight into the response of fish assemblages to protection from the perspective of MPA monitoring.},

  abstract = {A long-standing question in community ecology is whether food webs are organized in compartments, where species within the same compartment interact frequently among themselves, but show fewer interactions with species from other compartments. Finding evidence for this community organization is important since compartmentalization may strongly affect food web robustness to perturbation. However, few studies have found unequivocal evidence of compartments, and none has quantified the suite of mechanisms generating such a structure. Here, we combine computational tools from the physics of complex networks with phylogenetic statistical methods to show that a large marine food web is organized in compartments, and that body size, phylogeny, and spatial structure are jointly associated with such a compartmentalized structure. Sharks account for the majority of predatory interactions within their compartments. Phylogenetically closely related shark species tend to occupy different compartments and have divergent trophic levels, suggesting that competition may play an important role structuring some of these compartments. Current overfishing of sharks has the potential to change the structural properties, which might eventually affect the stability of the food web.},

Consequently, exclusion of species from a region depends on long-term regional-scale environmental change or evolutionary change among interacting populations, bringing species production and extinction onto the same scale and establishing a link between local and regional processes.},

  abstract = {The prevailing notion that interspecific competition has little impact on the abundances of tropical reef fishes has been tested by few experiments, all of which examined its effects on recruitment and juvenile demography rather than on adult abundances. This study, in Caribbean Panama, examined whether a common territorial damselfish, Stegastes planifrons, limits the abundances of adults of four ecologically similar congeners in S. planifrons' primary habitat: S. partitus and S. variabilis, which commonly occur in that habitat, and S. diencaeus and S. leucostictus, which rarely do. When S. planifrons was nearly eliminated from 16 natural patch reefs for 4-6 yr, adult populations of S. partitus, which is less aggressive and half the size of S. planifrons, doubled and expanded their range into a microhabitat previously used almost exclusively by adults of S. planifrons. Population increases by S. partitus occurred within 1 yr of the removal of S. planifrons, were persistent, but only reached their maximum ≈ 4 yr (and about four generations) after the initial removal. Adult populations of S. variabilis, which is less aggressive and 20% smaller than S. planifrons, also doubled following the removal of S. planifrons. Combined populations of S. partitus increased most on reefs where S. planifrons previously had been most dense. However, increases by those two species reached only ≈ 70% of the population density and ≈ 40% of the biomass density that S. planifrons had before the removals. Removal of S. planifrons had no effect on the abundances of S. diencaeus and S. leucostictus. Removal of S. partitus from eight reefs for 3 yr did not affect the abundances of S. planifrons or S. variabilis. Eleven years monitoring of adult populations and juvenile recruitment by S. partitus before and during the experiment show that its population increase after the removal of S. planifrons occurred while its overall abundance was gradually increasing, but was not associated with a period of unusually high juvenile recruitment. Thus asymmetric competition among closely related, ecologically similar, territorial coral reef fishes does sometimes control both abundances and microhabitat use in shared habitat. Interspecific territoriality and differences in body size and aggressiveness that lead to asymmetric competitive ability occur commonly among reef fishes in various trophic groups. Interspecific interactions within such groups of species often affect their patterns of habitat use. Hence the role that interspecific competition plays in limiting abundances of coral reef fishes requires reevaluation.},

Of particular concern is the ability of systems to recover where multiple stressors act simultaneously. We examine this issue in the context of a coral reef ecosystem where increases in stressors, such as fisheries, benthic degradation, cyclones and coral bleaching, are occurring at global scales. By utilizing long-term (decadal) monitoring programs, we examined the combined effects of chronic (removal of sharks) and pulse (cyclones, bleaching) disturbances on the trophic structure of coral reef fishes at two isolated atoll systems off the coast of northwest Australia. We provide evidence consistent with the hypothesis that the loss of sharks can have an impact that propagates down the food chain, potentially contributing to mesopredator release and altering the numbers of primary consumers. Simultaneously, we show how the effects of bottom-up processes of bleaching and cyclones appear to propagate up the food chain through herbivores, planktivores and corallivores, but do not affect carnivores. Because their presence may promote the abundance of herbivores, the removal of sharks by fishing has implications for both natural and anthropogenic disturbances involving the loss of corals, as herbivores are critical to the progress and outcome of coral recovery.},

  abstract = {Reef fishes are significant socially, nutritionally and economically, yet biologically they are vulnerable to both over-exploitation and degradation of their habitat. Their importance in the tropics for living conditions, human health, food security and economic development is enormous, with millions of people and hundreds of thousands of communities directly dependent, and many more indirectly so. Reef fish fisheries are also critical safety valves in times of economic or social hardship or disturbance, and are more efficient, less wasteful and support far more livelihoods per tonne produced than industrial scale fisheries. Yet, relative to other fisheries globally, those associated with coral reefs are under-managed, under-funded, under-monitored, and as a consequence, poorly understood or little regarded by national governments. Even among non-governmental organizations, which are increasingly active in tropical marine issues, there is typically little focus on reef-associated resources, the interest being more on biodiversity per se or protection of coral reef habitat. This essay explores the background and history to this situation, examines fishery trends over the last 3 0 years, and charts a possible way forward given the current realities of funding, capacity, development patterns and scientific understanding of coral reef ecosystems. The luxury live reef food-fish trade is used throughout as a case study because it exemplifies many of the problems and challenges of attaining sustainable use of coral reef-associated resources. The thesis developed is that sustaining reef fish fisheries and conserving biodiversity can be complementary, rather than contradictory, in terms of yield from reef systems. I identify changes in perspectives needed to move forward, suggest that we must be cautious of 'fashionable' solutions or apparent 'quick fixes', and argue that fundamental decisions must be made concerning the short and long-term values of coral reef-associated resources, particularly fish, for food and cash and regarding alternative sources of protein. Not to address the problems will inevitably lead to growing poverty, hardship and social unrest in many areas.},

  abstract = {Effective conservation requires rigorous baselines of pristine conditions to assess the impacts of human activities and to evaluate the efficacy of management. Most coral reefs are moderately to severely degraded by local human activities such as fishing and pollution as well as global change, hence it is difficult to separate local from global effects. To this end, we surveyed coral reefs on uninhabited atolls in the northern Line Islands to provide a baseline of reef community structure, and on increasingly populated atolls to document changes associated with human activities. We found that top predators and reef-building organisms dominated unpopulated Kingman and Palmyra, while small planktivorous fishes and fleshy algae dominated the populated atolls of Tabuaeran and Kiritimati. Sharks and other top predators overwhelmed the fish assemblages on Kingman and Palmyra so that the biomass pyramid was inverted (top-heavy). In contrast, the biomass pyramid at Tabuaeran and Kiritimati exhibited the typical bottom-heavy pattern. Reefs without people exhibited less coral disease and greater coral recruitment relative to more inhabited reefs. Thus, protection from overfishing and pollution appears to increase the resilience of reef ecosystems to the effects of global warming.},

This question has been raised before and resolved in favour of ¾. Like previous ones, recent claims for a value of 2/3 are based almost entirely on basal metabolic rate (BMR) in mammals. 2. Here we compile and analyse a new, larger data set for mammalian BMR. We show that interspecific variation in BMR, as well as field metabolic rates of mammals, and basal or standard metabolic rates for many other organisms, including vertebrates, invertebrates, protists and plants, all scale with exponents whose confidence intervals include ¾ and exclude 2/3. Our analysis of maximal metabolic rate gives a slope that is greater than and confidence intervals that exclude both ¾ and 2/3. 3. Additionally, numerous other physiological rates that are closely tied to metabolism in a wide variety of organisms, including heart and respiratory rates in mammals, scale as M-1/4 4. The fact that quarter-power allometric scaling is so pervasive in biology suggests that different allometric relations have a common, mechanistic origin and provides an empirical basis for theoretical models that derive these scaling exponents.},

Our study aimed to characterize these ocean temperature patterns at biologically relevant scales.Location  Global, with a focus on coral reefs.Methods  We created a 4-km resolution, 21-year global ocean temperature anomaly (deviations from long-term means) database to quantify the spatial and temporal characteristics of temperature anomalies related to both coral bleaching and disease. Then we tested how patterns varied in several key metrics of disturbance severity, including anomaly frequency, magnitude, duration and size.Results  Our analyses found both global variation in temperature anomalies and fine-grained spatial variability in the frequency, duration and magnitude of temperature anomalies. However, we discovered that even during major climatic events with strong spatial signatures, like the El Niño–Southern Oscillation, areas that had high numbers of anomalies varied between years. In addition, we found that 48% of bleaching-related anomalies and 44% of disease-related anomalies were less than 50 km2, much smaller than the resolution of most models used to forecast climate changes.Main conclusions  The fine-scale variability in temperature anomalies has several key implications for understanding spatial patterns in coral bleaching- and disease-related anomalies as well as for designing protected areas to conserve coral reefs in a changing climate. Spatial heterogeneity in temperature anomalies suggests that certain reefs could be targeted for protection because they exhibit differences in thermal stress. However, temporal variability in anomalies could complicate efforts to protect reefs, because high anomalies in one year are not necessarily predictive of future patterns of stress. Together, our results suggest that temperature anomalies related to coral bleaching and disease are likely to be highly heterogeneous and could produce more localized impacts of climate change.},

The relationship is not log-log linear as previously postulated. Only populations of mammals with body mass between 0.1 and 100 kg had allometric exponents approaching the value of -0.75 proposed by previous studies. Different trophic groups showed divergent relationships between density and body mass. Previous global analyses have disagreed with relationships between density and body mass in individual communities partly because of this nonlinearity. Analyses of 45 mammalian communities show positive, negative, or even no relationship between density and body mass, depending on the trophic groups and body sizes of community members and the range of sizes. Population energy use is inequitably partitioned among populations, with populations of large mammals using more than 100 times more energy than the smallest mammals. Herbivorous mammals can use 25 times the energy used by carnivores, and populations of small insectivores use only 10% of the energy used by other carnivores of equivalent body mass.},

  abstract = {1. Plots of local versus regional species richness are an exciting new tool for testing for species saturation in ecological communities. In this method, the local richness of a community is plotted as a function of its regional richness for different biogeographical regions. A proportional relationship between local and regional richness is interpreted as evidence for an unsaturated community, that is, a community with strong evolutionary limits to local richness. There will be no correlation between local and regional richness in a saturated community, that is, a community whose local species richness is limited largely by ecological processes. 2. Although at least 36 data sets have now been analysed using local-regional richness plots, there has not been much critical evaluation of the method. This paper provides such a critique, focusing on the selection of communities for comparison, the prevalence of pseudoreplication and multiple null models. and the effects of differing region size. 3. Local-regional richness plots are best suited for comparing similar habitats between different regions, not different habitats in a single region. In the latter, taxa effects and species pool effects are confounded. 4. Four very different types of local-regional richness plots have been published. Each type of plot has important underlying assumptions which are often not addressed by ecologists. 5. Of the 36 data sets reviewed in this paper, 13 were spatially pseudoreplicated, and 2 were temporally pseudoreplicated. Furthermore, ecologists differ in their choice of null model, with the result that the same local-regional plot could be interpreted as evidence for saturation by one ecologist, and for lack of saturation by another. 6. Differences in region size can result in pseudosaturation, the appearance of saturation by an unsaturated community. A simple model demonstrates this phenomenon. Other sources of error in estimating the regional species pool are also of concern. 7. In conclusion, local-regional richness plots are a potentially useful tool for distinguishing saturated from unsaturated communities, but should be used cautiously, and in conjunction with other supporting evidence (such as the presence or absence of competitive exclusion, resource limitation? density compensation and the effects of species invasions).},

  abstract = {Abstract: Diversity (or biodiversity) is typically measured by a species count (richness) and sometimes with an evenness index; it may also be measured by a proportional statistic that combines both measures (e.g., Shannon‐Weiner index or $H^{\prime }$ ). These diversity measures are hypothesized to be positively and strongly correlated, but this null hypothesis has not been tested empirically. We used the results of Caswell's neutral model to generate null relationships between richness (S), evenness ( $J^{\prime }$ ), and proportional diversity ( $H^{\prime }$ ). We tested predictions of the null model against empirical relationships describing data in a literature survey and in four individual studies conducted across various scales. Empirical relationships between $\mathrm{log}\,S$ or $J^{\prime }$ and $H^{\prime }$ differed from the null model when <10 species were tested and in plants, vertebrates, and fungi. The empirical relationships were similar to the null model when >10 and <100 species were tested and in invertebrates. If >100 species were used to estimate diversity, the relation between $\mathrm{log}\,S$ and $H^{\prime }$ was negative. The strongest predictive models included $\mathrm{log}\,S$ and $J^{\prime }$ . A path analysis indicated that $\mathrm{log}\,S$ and $J^{\prime }$ were always negatively related, that empirical observations could not be explained without including indirect effects, and that differences between the partials may indicate ecological effects, which suggests that S and $J^{\prime }$ act like diversity components or that diversity should be measured using a compound statistic.},

  abstract = {Overfishing threatens coral reefs worldwide, yet there is no reliable estimate on the number of reef fishers globally. We address this data gap by quantifying the number of reef fishers on a global scale, using two approaches - the first estimates reef fishers as a proportion of the total number of marine fishers in a country, based on the ratio of reef-related to total marine fish landed values. The second estimates reef fishers as a function of coral reef area, rural coastal population, and fishing pressure. In total, we find that there are 6 million reef fishers in 99 reef countries and territories worldwide, of which at least 25% are reef gleaners. Our estimates are an improvement over most existing fisher population statistics, which tend to omit accounting for gleaners and reef fishers. Our results suggest that slightly over a quarter of the world’s small-scale fishers fish on coral reefs, and half of all coral reef fishers are in Southeast Asia. Coral reefs evidently support the socio-economic well-being of numerous coastal communities. By quantifying the number of people who are employed as reef fishers, we provide decision-makers with an important input into planning for sustainable coral reef fisheries at the appropriate scale.},

  abstract = {All organisms, especially terrestrial plants and other sessile species, interact mainly with their neighbors, but neighborhoods can differ in composition because of dispersal and mortality. There is increasingly strong evidence that the spatial structure created by these forces profoundly influences the dynamics, composition, and biodiversity of communities. Nonspatial models predict that no more consumer species can coexist at equilibrium than there are limiting resources. In contrast, a similar model that includes neighborhood competition and random dispersal among sites predicts stable coexistence of a potentially unlimited number of species on a single resource. Coexistence occurs because species with sufficiently high dispersal rates persist in sites not occupied by superior competitors. Coexistence requires limiting similarity and two-way or three-way interspecific trade-offs among competitive ability, colonization ability, and longevity. This spatial competition hypothesis seems to explain the coexistence of the numerous plant species that compete for a single limiting resource in the grasslands of Cedar Creek Natural History Area. It provides a testable, alternative explanation for other high diversity communities, such as tropical forests. The model can be tested (1) by determining if coexisting species have the requisite trade-offs in colonization, competition, and longevity, (2) by addition of propagules of propagules to determine if local species abundances are limited by dispersal, and (3) by comparisons of the effects on biodiversity of high rates of propagule addition for species that differ in competitive ability.},

  abstract = {Global biodiversity is in decline. This is of concern for aesthetic and ethical reasons, but possibly also for practical reasons, as suggested by experimental studies, mostly with plants, showing that biodiversity reductions in small study plots can lead to compromised ecosystem function. However, inferring that ecosystem functions will decline due to biodiversity loss in the real world rests on the untested assumption that such loss is actually occurring at these small scales in nature. Using a global database of 168 published studies and >16,000 nonexperimental, local-scale vegetation plots, we show that mean temporal change in species diversity over periods of 5–261 y is not different from zero, with increases at least as likely as declines over time. Sites influenced primarily by plant species’ invasions showed a tendency for declines in species richness, whereas sites undergoing postdisturbance succession showed increases in richness over time. Other distinctions among studies had little influence on temporal richness trends. Although maximizing diversity is likely important for maintaining ecosystem function in intensely managed systems such as restored grasslands or tree plantations, the clear lack of any general tendency for plant biodiversity to decline at small scales in nature directly contradicts the key assumption linking experimental results to ecosystem function as a motivation for biodiversity conservation in nature. How often real world changes in the diversity and composition of plant communities at the local scale cause ecosystem function to deteriorate, or actually to improve, remains unknown and is in critical need of further study.},

The relationship between abundance and body size has been extensively studied in an attempt to quantify the form of the relationship and to understand the processes that generate it. However, progress has been impeded by the underappreciated fact that there are four distinct, but interrelated, relationships between size and abundance that are often confused in the literature. Here, we review and distinguish between these four patterns, and discuss the linkages between them. We argue that a synthetic understanding of size?abundance relationships will result from more detailed analyses of individual patterns and from careful consideration of how and why the patterns are related.},

  abstract = {Increased frequency of disturbances and anthropogenic activities are predicted to have a devastating impact on coral reefs that will ultimately change the composition of reef associated fish communities. We reviewed and analysed studies that document the effects of disturbance-mediated coral loss on coral reef fishes. Meta-analysis of 17 independent studies revealed that 62% of fish species declined in abundance within 3 years of disturbances that resulted in >10% decline in coral cover. Abundances of species reliant on live coral for food and shelter consistently declined during this time frame, while abundance of some species that feed on invertebrates, algae and/or detritus increased. The response of species, particularly those expected to benefit from the immediate loss of coral, is, however, variable and is attributed to erratic replenishment of stocks, ecological versatility of species and sublethal responses, such as changes in growth, body condition and feeding rates. The diversity of fish communities was found to be negatively and linearly correlated to disturbance-mediated coral loss. Coral loss >20% typically resulted in a decline in species richness of fish communities, although diversity may initially increase following small declines in coral cover from high coverage. Disturbances that result in an immediate loss of habitat complexity (e.g. severe tropical storms), have a greater impact on fishes from all trophic levels, compared with disturbances that kill corals, but leave the reef framework intact (e.g. coral bleaching and outbreaks of Acanthaster planci). This is most evident among small bodied species and suggests the long-term consequences of coral loss through coral bleaching and crown-of-thorn starfish outbreaks may be much more substantial than the short-term effects currently documented.},

  abstract = {The number of species coexisting in ecological communities must be a consequence of processes operating on both local and regional scales. Although a great deal of experimental work has been devoted to local causes of diversity, little is known about the effects of regional processes on local diversity and how they contribute to global diversity patterns in marine systems. We tested the effects of latitude and the richness of the regional species pool on the species richness of local epifaunal invertebrate communities by sampling the diversity of local sites in 12 independent biogeographic regions from 62degreesS to 63degreesN latitude. Both regional and local species richness displayed significant unimodal patterns with latitude, peaking at low latitudes and decreasing toward high latitudes. The latitudinal diversity gradient was represented at the scale of local sites because local species richness was positively and linearly related to regional species richness. The richness of the regional species pool explained 73-76% of local species richness. On a global scale, the extent of regional influence on local species richness was nonrandom-the proportion of regional biota represented in local epifaunal communities increased significantly from low to high latitudes. The strong effect of the regional species pool implies that patterns of local diversity in temperate, tropical, and high-latitude marine benthic communities are influenced by processes operating on larger spatiotemporal scales than previously thought.},

  abstract = {A more general biogeographic theory of island species number is produced by replacing area with a more direct measure of available energy in the models of MacArthur and Wilson and Preston. This theory, species-energy theory, extends beyond species-area theory in that it applies to islands that differ in their per-unit-area productivity due to differences in physical environment, such as climate. Examination of data on species number of angiosperms and of land and freshwater birds on islands worldwide, ranging from Greenland and Spitsbergen to New Guinea and Jamaica, demonstrates that species-energy theory can explain 70 to 80% of the variation in species number on such widely varying islands, and further suggests the existence of regular geographic trends in resource utilization or species-abundance patterns. The concepts embodied in species-energy theory can in principle be used to develop predictions of species' abundances and probabilities of occurrence on an island. Species-energy theory may also provide a unified basis for understanding a broad set of observations of patterns in species diversity.},

It is shown that irrespective of the original distribution of the data, the use of the asymmetric Laplace distribution is a very natural and effective way for modelling Bayesian quantile regression. The paper also demonstrates that improper uniform priors for the unknown model parameters yield a proper joint posterior. The approach is illustrated via a simulated and two real data sets.},

  abstract = {Understanding how biogeochemical cycles relate to the structure of ecological communities is a central research question in ecology. Here we approach this problem by focusing on body size, which is an easily measured species trait that has a pervasive influence on multiple aspects of community structure and ecosystem functioning. We test the predictions of a model derived from metabolic theory using data on ecosystem metabolism and community size structure. These data were collected as part of an aquatic mesocosm experiment that was designed to simulate future environmental warming. Our analyses demonstrate significant linkages between community size structure and ecosystem functioning, and the effects of warming on these links. Specifically, we show that carbon fluxes were significantly influenced by seasonal variation in temperature, and yielded activation energies remarkably similar to those predicted based on the temperature dependencies of individual-level photosynthesis and respiration. We also show that community size structure significantly influenced fluxes of ecosystem respiration and gross primary production, particularly at the annual time-scale. Assessing size structure and the factors that control it, both empirically and theoretically, therefore promises to aid in understanding links between individual organisms and biogeochemical cycles, and in predicting the responses of key ecosystem functions to future environmental change.},
